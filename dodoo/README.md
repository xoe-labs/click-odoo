# `dodoo` Base Component

## Abstract

`dodoo` is a CLI or library entrypoint to the dodoo server middleware for Odoo.

- `KF 1:` it hot-reloads config for DB, SMTP and the admin password.
- `KF 2:` it supports libpg dsn. (ej. for db server multiplexing)
- `KF 3:` set max connection per database.
- `KF 4:` dbfilter on odoo version and client project version.
- `KF 5:` mount registry (database) specific addon folders.
- `KF := Killer Feature`

**It provides:**

- A clean and well-defined interface to the Odoo namespace as `dodoo.odoo`
  package (`import dodoo.interfaces.odoo as odoo`).
- A clean and well-defined monkey patcher class to patch Odoo under the packages
  `dodoo.patchers` and `dodoo.patchers.odoo`. (`from dodoo.patchers import
  BasePatcher`)
- A clean and well-defined handle to the database and their schemata as
  `dodoo.connections` package. (`from dodoo.connections import OdooCursor,
  DodooCursor, PyblicCursor, SchemaCursor`).
- A clean and slick handle to the current repository puls Odoo specific helper
  mthods under the `dodoo.git` package (`from dodoo.git import Repo`)

**It does _not_ provide:**

- Command line switches for odoo server (‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®) -- if you have an appealing
  use case, submit a subcommand instead.
- Resource scheduling options (‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®) -- turn to your deployment framework
  of choice.
- Monolithic things (‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®) -- go back to jail and don't draw $10 from the
  bank.
