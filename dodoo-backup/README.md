# `dodoo backup` Component

## Abstract

`dodoo backup` subcommand backups and restores odoo instances.
This tool is intended for use in sporadic or manual operations, specifically in
the context of support operations or during development.

For a general backup solution for your odoo server, rather check out
[`borg`](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io).

<sub>Borg can use mount a backup repo and therefore might be a better alternative
for scaling up-to-date support staff access to customer databases.</sub>
